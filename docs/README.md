# Training Bot Documentation

This is the detailed developer documentation for Training Bot, and as such, we've written these docs with Lambda Labs teams who are inheriting this application in mind.

The following docs should be completed in order, both to ensure a smooth deployment and also to guarantee a scalable workflow for each developer:

1. [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md)
2. [Deployment](deployment.md)
3. [Setup](setup.md)

And the documentation listed below is more for reference, they describe big picture ideas like the directory structure of the application and how the data model works:

* [Database](database.md)
* [PM2](pm2.md)
* [Server jobs](jobs.md)

Feel free to open an issue mentioning [the maintainers](../.github/README.md#maintainers) if you have any questions or if anything is unclear, but try not to abuse this option :smile:
